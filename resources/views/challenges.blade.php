                    <p class="textabout">
                        Healthcare is a major concern in every society.Throughout the recent pandemic it has proved
vital for the continuity of nations, and humanity all around.
Algeria in particular has a very weak healthcare system that confirmed insuffisant to the
people’s needs, not only that but it is also considered hardly efficient, urging the citizens to
seek medical care and medicine in other countries.
These facts are not new to Algerian citizens, and in fact almost every Algerian is fully aware
and agrees that the country’s healthcare system is bad, but exactly how bad is it ?

        <li>
            In 2019, Algeria’s public healthcare network ranked as the 173rd most secure
healthcare network out of 195 nations.
        </li>
        <li>
            In 2015, there were ​ 250 operational private clinics​ , the presence of this private sector
heightens disparity in the quality of care that the healthcare system provided to
Algerians in different socio-economic classes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Due to an inability to provide physicians with the necessary equipment and a general
lack of human capital, there were 17 beds per 10,000 Algerians, according to ​ the
World Health Organization (WHO)​ in 2015. Because of this limited hospital capacity,
COVID-19 patients easily overran public healthcare in Algeria.

            Throughout the pandemic, government officials were notorious for failing to
communicate with the public to slow the spread of the virus. Villages located further
away from urban centers encountered these issues most prominently. &nbsp; <br/><br/>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://borgenproject.org/healthcare-in-algeria/">BargonProject website</a>

                    Violence in all its forms; physical, verbal or harassment is a serious matter that can
undeniably cause devastating damages and imbalance to one’s life and even the entire
society.
Algeria has witnessed many waves of violence, in all its various forms. Almost every
Algerian citizen has felt the threat of being robbed, harassed, or simply unsafe while roaming
the streets of Algeria, and this threat is even greater for women.
Some debate that the reason behind this violent behaviour is the inefficiency of the law
enforcements, but looking at the most recent statistics, we can see that algeria has witnessed a
-7.97 %​ ​ decrease in homicide rate between the years 2014 and 2015, and even a greater
decrease in the years before, indicating that algeria is making progress at limiting the
violence rate. <br/><br/>Source: <a  target="_blank" href="https://knoema.com/atlas/Algeria/Homicide-rate">Algeria-Homicide rate</a>

                        Poverty, homelessness, disease, disability and other forms of weakness and inability have
long existed in every society.
Life as we know it can become very challenging to people having these issues.
Unheard of, their struggles grow even more challenging as time goes by.
According to the Central Intelligence Agency, the population below the poverty line in
Algeria as of 2006 is estimated to be 25%, and rates of extreme poverty sit at 0.5%.
However, 10% of Algeria's population is perceived to be susceptible to falling back into
poverty if conditions conspire against them.<br/><br/> source: <a target="_blank" href="https://borgenproject.org/facts-about-poverty-algeria/?fbclid=IwAR3o6kiWgCxOFb7KfbM8t7ojgNidNEqny8I5MKWckrpX5e5Py0YmqByl62M">The Borgen project</a>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to that, disability prevalence in Algeria is estimated to be 5.5%, or 1,088,000 to
1,605,160 people with disabilities. There are concerns however about underreporting of
disability, particularly of people with intellectual or psychosocial disabilities; <br/><br/>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5b2378d340f0b634cb3dd823/Disability_in_North_Africa.pdf">K4D</a>
<br/>
<br/>
More people are resorting to social media, to post about their cases or other people’s cases in
need of help, and most of the time the public reach out to them and offer aid.

                    <p class="textabout">
One cannot deny the importance of education to the foundation and strength of every country.
a country with a strong educational system is a country that is solid, economically and that is
more resilient to imbalance and crises.
The role of education in poverty reduction is huge. Some advantages of education are: it
boosts economic growth and increases the GDP of a country. It even reduces infant mortality
rate, increasing human life expectancy. Education is an important investment in a country as
there are huge benefits.

<br/>
<br/>
As a developing country, Algeria can certainly make a lot of changes to improve its
educational system. One of those changes is establishing a new parent-teacher
communication system.
<br/>
<br/>
Through regular communication with parents, teachers can share information about a
student’s good work and achievements. If a student begins to struggle with a certain subject
or exhibits behavioral problems, the parent will already have a relationship with the teacher,
which helps facilitate parent-teacher collaboration. This cooperative relationship empowers
parents to step in and support the student at home, supplementing what the teacher is doing at
school.
